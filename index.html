        <p>At first glance, the process of making sushi can seem daunting. When you sit at the bar
             and watch the chef prepare you roll you see his hands are almost a blur.
             The precision with which he uses his knife seems surgical 
             and what was once a disparate of ingredients, put together in a specific 
             order with best practice standards will 
             invariably result in the product that will
              undoubtably impress your peers.</p>
        <p>The goal of each recipe you find will be to use the same ingredients but with different easily mastered
            techniques you will be able to make 3 unique recipes.
